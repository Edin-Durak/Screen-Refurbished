# Upwork Project

As a freelancer on Upwork, I had a task to transform a provided Figma file into responsive HTML/CSS/JS code. Since the website is a landing page for screen repair services, I suggested to the client a mobile-first approach. We expect that users will visit the website primarily via phone.

I paid close attention to this project as I was upgrading my CSS skills. One problem I encountered was the layout breaking due to the width of the iframe and images on mobile screens. Using these styles at the beginning of my CSS solved the problem:

```css
img,
iframe {
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

As developers, we constantly encounter problems and develop our skills by understanding and fixing them.
